# Population-Health-Analytics
The project explores population health data using queries to generate actionable insights across three domains- chronic conditions, patient encounters, and immunizations. Each domain is structured into five questions, producing a total of 15 queries.

**Part 1**: **Chronic Conditions**
- Focuses on prevalence, expenses, immunization and demographics of chronic diseases.

**Part 2**: **Encounters**
- Analyzes patient interaction patterns , track conditions, and identify top conditions.

**Part 3**: Conditions & Immunizations
Examines preventive care and condition timelines, identifies each patient's earliest record condition and calculates overall flu vaccine coverage for 2023.


**Datasets Used**
- Patients: Demographic and socioeconomic details (birthdate, income, expenses, gender).
- Conditions: Clinical diagnoses with onset/resolution dates and descriptions.
- Immunizations: records for vaccines administered.
